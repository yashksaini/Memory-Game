# Memory Game

Memory Game is a fun and challenging web-based game that tests your memory and concentration skills. The objective is to match all 10 pairs of cards on a 4x5 board in the least amount of time. Each turn, you can flip two cards to find matching pairs. If the cards don't match, they flip back upside down, and you need to remember their positions for future turns.

## About the Project
Memory Game is an interactive and entertaining web-based game that challenges players to match pairs of cards within the least amount of time. The game presents a 4x5 board with a total of 20 facedown cards. On each turn, you can click on two cards to flip them face up. The goal is to find all 10 pairs of matching cards.

If the two flipped cards match, they are removed from the board, and you can focus on other pairs. If they don't match, they flip back face down, and you must remember their positions for future turns. The game is completed when all 10 pairs are successfully matched.

The game keeps track of the time taken to complete the game, allowing you to challenge yourself to improve your time in subsequent plays. It also provides visual feedback for successful matches and incorrect attempts, making the gameplay engaging and rewarding.
